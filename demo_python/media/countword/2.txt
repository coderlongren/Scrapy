"What are they doing?" I asked the boatman. 

"They are using their propellers to break the reef," he said. 

Again I was sceptical. The only way to see for sure was to get in the water. 

It was murky and filled with dust and sand. I could just make out a steel propeller spinning in the distance on the end of long shaft, but it was impossible to tell exactly how the destruction was being carried out. 

The result was clear, though. Complete devastation.

This place had once been a rich coral ecosystem. Now the sea floor was covered in a thick layer of debris, millions of smashed fragments of coral, white and dead like bits of bone.
